# salaryCalculator
A quick little Android utility app that helps calculate your fortnightly salary

I created this app to cut down the time it takes me to calculate my fortnightly salary. Using the calculator app to would 
leave me with long equation-like math questions like: (5x34)+(2x34)+(6x46)+.....
I'd usually mess it up and have to look through it again to figure out where I went wrong. It was hardwork, timeconsuming, complicated,
and annoying. 

I decided to come up with the app as a solution to this problem. Feel free to give it a go. It's simple and easy to use.
I love it! I use it everytime new rosters come out!
